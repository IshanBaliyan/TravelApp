# TravelApp
## Login-based travel app for bookmarking and reviewing your favourite map locations. 

# Built using MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js

# Purpose
I built this app for recording and "pinning" all the places I visited. However, I created an account-management system so my family and friends can also pin the places they've been to, and we can track the places we've visited, as well as our reviews.
